Strings 1

In our first strings task, we start off small. You already have half of a famous quote inside a variable called quoteStart; we would like you to:

1. Look up the other half of the quote, and add it to the example inside a variable called quoteEnd.
2. Concatenate the two strings together to make a single string containing the complete quote. Save the result inside a variable called finalQuote.

You'll find that you get an error at this point. Can you fix the problem with quoteStart, so that the full quote displays correctly?
